# DMYSYS
## DMYSYS (Dummy System) is a custom-built discord bot designed to run on the NERV(TOKYO-3) discord server.
This repo acts as a way for people in the community to find issues with the bot, and help me fix, optimize and expand DMYSYS.

# PACKAGES REQUIRED
- Pillow (pip install pillow)
- Discord.Py Version 1.7.3 (pip install discord.py==1.7.3)
- discord-py-slash-command version 2.3.2 (pip install discord-py-slash-command==2.3.2)

  "Why these specific versions?" Because they seemed to work the best for me.
